# Plotly Challenge

The purpose of this assignment was to build an interactive dashboard which will allow a user to explore the dataset.

The dataset for this assignment consists of Belly Button Biodiversity in JSON file format. Data was read in using d3.json functionality. Using Plotly, d3 and javascript, data was parsed and used to create bar, gauge and bubble graphs as well as a demographics box and test subject dropdown. Using the test subject dropdown, users can select test subjects which will then trigger all of the graphs and boxes on the page to refresh with information from that specific test subject. Bar and bubble graphs also include tooltip functionality which displays additional information on the sample once clicked.
