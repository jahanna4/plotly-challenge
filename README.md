# Plotly Challenge

The purpose of this assignment was to build an interactive dashboard which will allow a user to explore the dataset.

The dataset for this assignment consists of Belly Button Biodiversity in JSON file format. Data was read in using d3.json functionality. Using Plotly, d3 and javascript, data was parsed and used to create bar, gauge and bubble graphs as well as a demographics box and test subject dropdown.
